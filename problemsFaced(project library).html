      //Issue no 1:   I faced issue while creating read/unread togglebar dynamically with each new item.The issue was i got the style of span(i.e the round shaped bar with bg color #ccc) throughout my container instead of fitting in card not working.The cause which i figured out after spending a lot of time was that i appended my span and input in my bookCard container which is huge while i just should have appended my label in card and span and input in label and not card.
